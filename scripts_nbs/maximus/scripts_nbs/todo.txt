1. Focal loss (did not work)
2. Add BCE loss to f1_loss (worked)
2a. Test with yellow images as well (in progress)
3. KFold and other iteration methods (Kfold worked, other methods, slightly worse results)
3a. Experiment with class weights (did not work)
3b. TTA (in progress)
4. KFold + ridge (Kfold worked, ridge at after level 1 did not work)
5. Multiple models
6. Rdige ensemble
7. add conv2d to test with yellow images
8. greyscale + adding denoinsing and canny
9. add F2 loss
10.Adam + adagrad ( check!)
11. image augmentation all of
12. make variations of test images, predict all, take mean
13. take mode='max' for modelcheckpoint, monitor='val_f1'
